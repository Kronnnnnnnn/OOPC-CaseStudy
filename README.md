The Student Management System is a simple C++ console-based application that allows users to add, view, and search student records using a menu-driven interface. It utilizes structs to represent students and vectors for dynamic storage. Key features include data validation, formatted display of student details, and interactive input/output, making it an ideal beginner project to understand core C++ programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and data structures.
